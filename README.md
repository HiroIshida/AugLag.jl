## Aula.jl: An implementation of augmented lagrangian method in Julia ![CI](https://github.com/HiroIshida/Aula.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

The main algorithm of aula is implemented referring Nocedal et al. [1]. The unconstraind-subproblem is solved using Levenbergâ€“Marquardt-like method , where the lagrangian function is approximated by a gauss-newton approximation. The solver for the subproblem is implemented referring Toussaint et. al. [2], where all the tuning parameter is set as the same in the paper.
